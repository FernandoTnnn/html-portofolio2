<h1>About You</h1>
<p>I know a place<br>
It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face<br>
We get married in our heads<br>
Something to do while we try to recall how we met.</p>

<p>Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten<br>
About you?</p>

<p>You and I (Don't let go)<br>
We're alive (Don't let go)<br>
With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes<br>
Wait (Don't let go)<br>
And pretend (Don't let go, oh)<br>
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end (In the end)<br>
.</p>

<p>Do you think I havе forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I havе forgotten<br>
About you?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten<br>
About you?</p>

<p>And there was something about you that now I can't remember<br>
It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender<br>
And I'll miss you on a train, I'll miss you in the mornin'<br>
I never know what to think about<br>
I think about you (Don't let go)<br>
About you (Don't let go)</p>

<p>Do you think I have forgotten<br>
About you?<br>
About you (Don't let go, oh)<br>
About you<br>
About you<br>
Do you think I have forgotten<br>
About you?<br>
About you (Don't let go)</p>
